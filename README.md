# LLMdevelopment
Repository of my self-created private agents. 

## Agents
Contains self created llm-agents, currently only for coding tasks.
More to come as I try and test these on other private repos

## MCP
Contains self created MCP tools. 
Currently only contains the (one) working MCP server which is a adder that is designed to fail. Made this to see and investigate how the MCP protocol in instantiated and what context the agents actually rely on when using MCP.
