# LLM Development Tools

## To make this work:
- Create .claude folder with .mcp.json
- Update .claude (ot where you have it) settings.local.json

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Anthropic MCP Guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)

## Agents
Contains self created llm-agents, currently only for coding tasks.
More to come as I try and test these on other private repos

## MCP
Contains self created MCP tools including:
- **boxer-stats**: Fetch any boxer's statistics from mrboxhist.se
- **mcp_fail_adder**: Math adders with random numbers for testing MCP protocol
